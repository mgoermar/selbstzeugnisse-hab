# Correspondence Map
A geographic visualization of correspondence between abolitionists in the 19th century

# Project Set Up
This project consists of two parts:

1. A parser for downloading data from the DPLA API
2. A map that visualizes the data using LeafletJS

## Parser
1. In order to use the parser you will need to install NodeJS.
2. After installing Node, you will need to install the project dependencies
   1. Open a command prompt window and navigate to the parser folder where the project is located
      1. Type `cd [directory where you saved the project]`
   2. run `npm install`. This will create a folder called `node_modules` and will install the libraries you need into it.
3. Create a file using notepad or another plain text editor called `config.json` in the `parser` folder with the text below. Replace `[API Key]` with your DPLA API key.

   ```
   {
     "api_key": "[API Key]"
   }
   ```
4. From the command prompt window run `node get-data.js`. This will download the data into a file called letters.csv

## Setting up the map
Before running the map you will need to save the `letters.csv` file you created with the parser into the main repository folder. The repo includes a sample letters file named `letters-sample.csv`. To use this data set simply rename this file to `letters.csv`. If you are using your own data, the map assumes that you have a file named `letters.csv` with at least the following columns:

| Field              | Column Name      |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| Sender             | sender           |
| Recipient          | recipient        |
| Title              | title            |
| Link               | link             |
| Date               | date             |
| Place              | place            |
| Sent Location      | sentLocation     |
| Received Location  | receivedLocation |
| Sender Latitude    | senderLat        |
| Sender Longitude   | senderLng        |
| Receiver Latitude  | receiverLat      |
| Receiver Longitude | receiverLng      |

### Remote web server
If you have a website with FTP access, the easiest thing to do is copy all the files in this repository to your web server in a folder called something like `map`. The map should then be available on your website at that folder i.e. `http://www.yourdomain.com/map`

### Local web server
There are a number of ways to run a local web server, one of the easiest with Node is to use the `node-server` module.

1. Open a command line and navigate to the folder where the project is located.
2. Run `npm install -g jitsu`
3. Run `jitsu install http-server`
4. Run `node http-server/bin/http-server`

There will now be a server running by default on port 8080. To visit the map open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`

To stop the server you will hit `Ctrl-C`. To start the server again, you don't need to download it again, just run `node http-server/bin/http-server`

# Code Organization

## Parser
All the code for the parser is contained in the `parser` folder. At present this is a single file named `get-data.js`, a configuration file named `config.json`, and a `package.json` for node installation.

## Map
The core code of the map is organized into four different files, all of which can be found in the `js` folder:

* `controls.js` contains functions that handle the time line slider and filters.
* `data.js` contains functions that load and handle the initial formatting of the CSV file.
* `map.js` contains all the code which loads and displays the map layers, including filtering the layers in response to the controls.
* `sidebar.js` contains the code which displays detailed letter information in the sidebar when a line or point is clicked.
